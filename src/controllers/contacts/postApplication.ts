/**
 * Project Name: Kunal Chandra Das Portfolio backend
 * File Name:    Post contact applications
 * Author      : Kunal Chandra Das
 * Date        : 03.11.2024
 * Version     : 2.0.0
 * Details     : This file contains the controller for handling the submission
 *               of a "Contact Us" application by a user. It allows users to
 *               send inquiries or feedback to the admin through the platformâ€™s
 *               "Contact Us" form.
 *
 *               The controller validates the data submitted by the user, ensuring
 *               that all required fields (e.g., name, email, message) are included
 *               and properly formatted. If any of the required fields are missing
 *               or contain invalid data, the controller will return a `400 Bad Request`
 *               response with an appropriate error message.
 *
 *               Once the input data is validated, the controller stores the contact
 *               submission in the database. It includes the user's name, email,
 *               and message, and any additional data or metadata that may be included
 *               in the contact form. After successfully storing the data, the controller
 *               returns a `201 Created` response with a success message, indicating
 *               that the contact application has been successfully submitted.
 *
 *               If there is an issue during submission (e.g., database failure,
 *               validation errors), the controller returns an appropriate error message.
 *
 *               This controller plays a crucial role in enabling users to reach
 *               out to the platform administrators with inquiries, feedback, or
 *               concerns. It ensures that the submission process is secure, valid,
 *               and efficient, while also providing feedback to the user about
 *               the status of their contact request.
