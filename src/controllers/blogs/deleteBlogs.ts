/**
 * Project Name: Kunal Chandra Das Portfolio backend
 * File Name:    Delete blog article controller
 * Author      : Kunal Chandra Das
 * Date        : 03.11.2024
 * Version     : 2.0.0
 * Details     : This file contains the controller for handling the deletion of
 *               blog articles in the system. It allows authenticated users or
 *               admins to delete blog articles from the database.
 *
 *               The controller first verifies if the user making the request
 *               has the necessary permissions to delete the article (e.g.,
 *               checking if the user is the author of the article or if the
 *               user has admin privileges). If the user is authorized, the
 *               controller proceeds to delete the specified blog article from
 *               the database using the articleâ€™s unique identifier (e.g., article ID).
 *
 *               The controller checks if the article exists before attempting
 *               to delete it. If the article does not exist, a `404 Not Found`
 *               response is returned. After successful deletion, the controller
 *               sends a success message indicating that the article was deleted.
 *
 *               In case of any errors (e.g., database failure, permission issues),
 *               the controller returns an appropriate error message.
 *
 *               This controller helps manage blog content by allowing authorized
 *               users to delete articles that are no longer needed or inappropriate.
