/**
 * Project Name: Kunal Chandra Das Portfolio backend
 * File Name:    Upload Resume
 * Author      : Kunal Chandra Das
 * Date        : 31.10.2024
 * Version     : 2.0.0
 * Details     : This file contains the controller for uploading a new resume
 *               to the system. The controller allows authorized users (e.g.,
 *               users or admins) to submit a new resume for storage in the
 *               platformâ€™s database.
 *
 *               The controller first validates the incoming request to ensure
 *               that all necessary fields for the resume are included in the
 *               request body. Required fields typically include the user's name,
 *               contact information, work experience, skills, education, and
 *               any other relevant data that should be part of the resume.
 *
 *               If any required fields are missing or contain invalid data,
 *               the controller returns a `400 Bad Request` response, with an
 *               appropriate error message detailing what is missing or incorrect.
 *
 *               Once the data is validated, the controller checks if the user
 *               has uploaded a valid resume file (e.g., PDF, DOCX) and whether
 *               the file meets the required size and format constraints. If the
 *               resume file is valid, the controller proceeds to store the resume
 *               in the database, along with any necessary metadata such as the
 *               file URL, upload timestamp, and user ID.
 *
 *               If the upload is successful, a `201 Created` response is returned,
 *               containing the details of the newly uploaded resume, including
 *               the resume ID, user details, and other relevant resume metadata.
 *
 *               If the file is invalid or the upload fails for any reason (e.g.,
 *               file size too large, unsupported format), a `415 Unsupported Media Type`
 *               response is returned, with an appropriate error message.
 *
 *               In case of any failure during the upload process (e.g., database
 *               issues), the controller returns a `500 Internal Server Error` response.
 *
 *               This controller is essential for enabling users to upload their
 *               resumes securely, ensuring that the platform can accept and store
 *               valid resume data and associated files. It is a critical part of
 *               the resume management process, facilitating the addition of new resumes
 *               to the system.
